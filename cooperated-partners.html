HAL has been taking CSR initiatives as a “call from within’ even before it was officially mandated. The CSR activities of HAL are tuned towards improving the quality of life of the socially & economically backwards groups and marginalized & weaker sections of the Society, in the vicinity of its operational areas. HAL has always been striving to meet the needs of the people through its various community development activities. Contributing towards establishment of the Guniagrahara Kitchen of the Akshaya Patra Foundation, is yet another step taken by HAL in giving back to the Society. The above Kitchen, designed to serve nutritious food to the School going children, will not only eradicate hunger but will also go a long way in ensuring students’ attendance.
